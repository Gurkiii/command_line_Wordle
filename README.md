# command line Wordle

This is a command line version of Wordle written in Haskell.

It's written in IntelliJ by JetBrains using the IntelliJ Haskell plugin by Rik van der Kleij.

It plays by the same rules, just on the command line. However, instead of grey, yellow or green tiles, it says w (wrong), y or r (right) respectively.

Just load it up, choose a wordle and start typing in your guesses.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me via Twitter or Discord (see linktree).
